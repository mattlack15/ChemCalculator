Calculator for stoichiometry

This is a console-based stoichiometry calculator. To use it, run main() in Main.java and enter an equation such as 2H_2O -> 2H_2 + O_2 or a compound such as H_2O. It will
either give you options on calculating moles needed for a reaction, or give you the molar mass of the compound.
